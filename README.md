# Project-2- Civitas
The purpose of our project is to connect people with an illness to others with the same illness in an online community. The community would offer resources and support in the way of articles, area groups, and the ability to socialize with others. 

API's: In order to gather the resources we used the healthfinder API to gather articles, resources, and information.

New Tech: For a new technology, we used nodemailer, which will send email and connect the users to each other to build the sense of community.

Front-end: used materialize for some styling as well as css and bootstrap. 

Back-end: built a table to accumulate the users data and information with Sequelize, 

Future Developement: add a blog post question and answer page for reccomendations (dr's, meds, etc.), events manager to host meet-ups etc,
